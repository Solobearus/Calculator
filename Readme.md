Hello, My name is Ivan and I created an awesome little calculator to showcase some php skills.
This is an awesome calculator that can take a free string expression and calculate the result of it.

It also supports caching using Radis, so for every expression that is valid and had a result, 
we store it in the memory so that if we type it again it will fetch the result from memory this time and not recalculate.
